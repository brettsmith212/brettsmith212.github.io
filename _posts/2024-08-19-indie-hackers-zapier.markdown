**Summary**

Looking through Forums to find business ideas. In forums are where people post their pain points with a product and requests for improvements. This is where Wade was able to get verification that his product (automation) was desired. He would look at Salesforce, Google Contacts, etc forums and the biggest need was to have a no code solution for non technical people.
